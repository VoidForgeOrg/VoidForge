# Resources

## Overview

Voidforge uses a **physical economy**. Resources are tangible goods that exist on specific planets — there is no global bank or abstract wallet. Everything is stored in **planetary storage** on the planet where it was produced or delivered.

## Resource Progression Tree

Resources follow a **progression tree** — raw materials are extracted, refined into higher-tier materials, and ultimately used for production (ships, buildings, etc.).

### MVP Progression

For MVP, the tree is kept simple and linear with a single resource chain:

```
Iron Ore (raw) → Iron Ingot (refined) → Ships / Buildings (final products)
```

> **Post-MVP Note:** The progression tree is designed to be **branching** with multiple resource types. For example, different ores could be refined into different alloy types depending on the desired end product. This branching complexity will be introduced after MVP.

### Resource Types (MVP)

1. **Iron Ore** — Raw material extracted from planetary resource pools via Drills.
2. **Iron Ingots** — Refined from Iron Ore via Refineries. Used for building construction and ship building.
3. **Energy** — Flow resource generated by Generators (see Energy section below).

## Resource Pools

Each planet has **finite, per-resource-type pools** representing the natural deposits available on that planet.

- A planet has an Iron Ore pool (e.g., 50,000 units).
- Pools are **depletable** — once mined out, they are gone.
- Pool sizes are a core planet property, determined at world generation.
- Depletion creates natural pressure to **expand, scout, and colonize** new planets.

> **MVP Scope:** Pools do not regenerate. Once depleted, they are permanently exhausted.

## Resource Distribution

When multiple buildings compete for the same resource (e.g., 2 Refineries consuming Iron Ore, or a Shipyard and construction both consuming Iron Ingots), the available supply is **split evenly** among all consumers.

**Example:** A planet produces 10t ore/hr and has 2 Refineries that each want 8t/hr. Each Refinery receives 5t/hr and operates at reduced throughput.

> **Design Intent:** Even distribution prevents any single building from starving others. Players must plan their building ratios to avoid bottlenecks.

## Planetary Storage

All extracted and refined resources are held in **planetary storage** on the planet where they exist.

- Each planet has a **fixed storage capacity per resource type** (e.g., Iron Ore cap: 10,000, Iron Ingot cap: 5,000).
- **If storage is full:** The building producing that resource **halts** and consumes only **5% of its normal energy draw**.
- Resources must be **physically transported** between planets via fleets (see fleet docs).

> **Post-MVP Note:** Storage capacity can be expanded by constructing additional storage buildings.

## Energy

Energy is a **flow resource**, not a stockpile. It is generated and consumed continuously.

- Generators produce energy measured in MW (e.g., 2,000 MW output).
- Buildings consume energy to operate (e.g., total consumption of 1,800 MW).
- **If production >= consumption:** Everything runs at full efficiency.
- **If consumption > production (overloaded):** Building productivity drops proportionally across the planet.
- Energy is **per-planet** — it cannot be transferred between planets.

> **Design Intent:** Energy creates a balancing act. Every new building adds power draw, so players must invest in generators to sustain growing infrastructure. Expanding too aggressively without energy support cripples productivity.
